##### Description : Made a small snap shot of my current life
##### Person who Peer Reviewed your assignment : Gavin - Looks pretty close to the Figma. The only page that seems to have a hard time matching is your index page, but everything else looks good.


# Figma Your Life

This is my personal website. I made it from scratch using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. It shows who I am and what I’ve done.

## Why I Made It

I wanted something simple that feels like me. It’s based on a design I made in Figma.

## What’s In It

- A homepage with a background and intro  
- A page about my interests  
- A page about my accomplishments  
- A menu at the bottom to switch pages

## Tools I Used

- HTML  
- CSS  
- Bootstrap  
- Figma
